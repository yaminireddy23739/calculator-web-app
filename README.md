# Calculator Web Application 

A responsive calculator web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with a strong focus on implementing **realistic calculator logic**, especially the percentage (%) operation.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates the behavior of a real mobile calculator.  
Special attention was given to the **percentage (%) functionality**, which behaves differently from JavaScript’s modulus operator.

The goal of this project was to strengthen logic building, DOM manipulation, and handling edge cases in JavaScript.

## ✨ Features

- Basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- **Mobile-friendly percentage (%) calculation**
- All Clear (AC) and Backspace functionality
- Clean and modern user interface
- Fully responsive design

## 📊 Percentage Logic Behavior

Unlike the modulus operator, the percentage logic follows real calculator behavior:

- `50 %` → `0.5`
- `8 % 2` → `0.16`

This ensures accurate and user-friendly results.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript
  
## 📚 Key Learnings

- Understanding real-world calculator logic
- Handling edge cases in JavaScript
- Debugging and fixing logical errors
- Improving UI/UX for better usability
- Writing clean and structured code

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Keyboard input support  
- Scientific calculator functions
